# Modules

We organise modules according to the following pipeline

* `loaddata` Data loading modules to get the input data from somewhere.
* `prepdata` Preprocessing of data for learning and prediction.
* `embed` Machine learning modules for embedding data into new spaces to learn a new representation, including feature extraction.
* `predict` Machine learning modules for predicting a desired output.
* `evaluate` Performance evaluation using some metrics.
* `pipeline` Machine learning pipelines
